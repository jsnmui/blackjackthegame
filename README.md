## Explanations of specific technologies 
### HTML 
HTML is a language used to describe the content and structure of our documents. 
HTML elements that show things like text, images, and lists
Elements have attributes that allow us to add additional information
Elements can contain other elements

### CSS
Rules that specify how your elements should appear or look on your page.

### JavaScript

### Document Object Model (DOM)
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.

## Game Instructions
### Goal
 Beat the dealer by getting a hand as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21. A blackjack occurs when you get one ace and one 10 point card on the first hand.

### Gameplay

* The dealer and player are initially dealt 2 cards each.
* The dealer's second card will be placed face down.
* You can choose to either hit (receive more cards) or stand (end your turn).
* The dealer must draw on 16 or under and must stand on 17 or over.
* You can hit as many times as you choose so long as your deck is under 21.
* You can place bets by clicking on the betting chips or entering a value in the input box.
* Game is over when you run out of money.
* Press RESTART to reset the game.
### Card Values

* Jacks, Kings, and Queens are worth 10 points.
* Number cards are worth their face value.
* Aces can be worth either 11 or 1.
* Aces have a default value of 11 unless that would result in a total score over 21. In that case, it is worth 1 point.
